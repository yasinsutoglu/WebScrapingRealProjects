A company that sells books online realized that low sales in the "Travel" and "Non-Fiction" categories.
For this reason, the company needs to do taking the information of the books and prices from the given 
https://books.toscrape.com/, to be allowed to scrape off, and then analyzing the competitors' 
"Travel" and "Nonfiction" categories. Then, each book in these categories is to be scraped off
in details and the system needs to be automatized.
